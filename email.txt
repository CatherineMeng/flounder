Hi Prof. Anshelevich,

Things are going well and I'm working on
methods of mesh modification that are more
amenable to hardware acceleration.

In this code I have some graph concepts
that I was hoping you might know
the names for, if they exist:

1) a bipartite graph where all vertices
on one side have the same degree.
This is almost the same as bi-regular,
but the vertices on the other side do
not have the same degree

2) a graph G' that includes the old
graph G's edges as nodes:
V' = V + E
E' = {(v,e) | e \in E, e = (v,u)}

Thanks again,
