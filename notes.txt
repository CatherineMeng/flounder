compute_fes and graph_rgraph_transit are dominating serial runtime,
given that they use the adjacency set operations: intersect and unite.
adding statistics collection to compute_fes shows that the
average value of ve[k].n is 6 and its max value is 8.
these are very small arrays, and we intend to take their
intersection or union...

using "-O2" instead of "-O1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer" does not reduce
runtime that much, as measured by omp_get_wtime on my i3 laptop
